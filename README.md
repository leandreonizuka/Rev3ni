I created this tool because sometimes I don't have internet and I need to have online reverse shells handy... yes, I could have written them all down in my notes. But no.

## Introduction
This tool will spwane you a reverse shell previously configured with the "LHOST" & the "LPORT". You can encode it in base64 or Urlencoding.
